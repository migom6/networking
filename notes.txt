The Payload Length field is 16 bits wide, which means that a normal 
payload exceed 64K octets including the internet header and data 
(65,507 bytes = 65,535 − 8 bytes UDP header − 20 bytes IP header); 
this is generally true for loopback interfaces, but such long datagram
 messages are impractical for most hosts and networks.

The MTU is the largest size a given link layer technology can support for 
datagram messages. For any link, IPv4 mandates a minimum MTU of 68 octets,
 while the recommended MTU for IPv4 is 576 (typically recommended as the 
 MTU for dial-up type applications), whether they arrive whole or in fragments.

For IPv6, the minimum MTU is 1280 octets, however, the mandatory minimum 
fragment reassembly buffer size is 1500 octets. The value of 68 octets is very small,
 since most current link layer technologies, like Ethernet, have a minimum MTU of 1500.
